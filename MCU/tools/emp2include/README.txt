This directory holds the *.emp files generated by the EM Micro tools (e.g. EM9304 Configuration Editor) or EM Micro developers (code patches).

All *.emp files contained in this directory will result in the generation of a patch or patches to be
applied to the EM9304.

The script emp2include.py has the following usage:

$ ./emp2include.py --help
usage: emp2include.py [-h] [-o MEMORY]

Convert multiple EM9304 *.emp files to the em9304_patches.* files.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -o MEMORY   Destination memory (IRAM or OTP)

Patches can be applied temporarily to IRAM and then permanently applied to OTP (one-time programable) memory 
as needed.  The default is IRAM.

The files em9304_patches.h and em9304_patches.c will be generated in the following directory:

/third_party/exactle/sw/hci/ambiq/em9304

	* Format Version - Container format version (increments as container is updated)
	* Patch ID - Unique identifier for the container/patch (assigned by patch creator)
	* Build number - EM9304 ROM minor revision supported by patch
	* User Build - User defined number (assigned by patch creator)
